# Model Explainers

## Goals

- Leave the participants with working examples.
- Have documented instructions and references for further learning.
- Cite experts based on your research.
- Make sure your entire team contributes.

## Sample Code

Check out model_explainers.ipynb for the example code so you can follow along.

### What is a model explainer?  

Model explainers help explain the "black box" that are machine learning models.  
As we've been going in class, we've been generating hundreds of features. But training a model on so many features can be resource intensive. It can also take time to generate all those features. By figuring out the features that are most relevant to our model, we can focus on those. We could even drop our useless features (no correlation to the final output prediction) and generate more features that are like our most important features.  

Another advantage to model explainers is understanding individual instances that our model predicts. In statistics, we can understand things "on the average". That is to say, if someone was to apply for a loan, we can say "because most people that are approved for a loan have a credit score of 750, and your credit score is 700, you're unlikely to be approved for a loan". However, if we had a model explainer for a machine learning model that decides if you are approved for a loan, we could look at each factor that changes the final outcome, and how much it changes it by. We'll show an example of this more in later sections

### What do we do with the information a model explainer gives us?

### SHAP  

For more information about the math behind SHAP, [check out this website](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html).  
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (Shapley values are a solution concept in cooperative game theory).

SHAP Values are used in the SHAP model explainer to show how each feature and value correlate the model output.

Here are a few examples of graphs and insights that SHAP can give. Check out the sample code for more information on how to create these graphs.

Some things to note: SHAP works best with decision tree and neural network models. While you can use it with KNN (or really, any other type of model), it's not as good. We won't be going over it in this training. If you're interested in knowing more, see [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62211302/obtaining-the-shap-values-for-a-prediction-made-with-knn).

### DALEX

Dalex is another package you can use to explain your macine learning model. It is actually very similar to Shap. You can use Dalex to check the importance of each feature, and how each feature contributes to the final prediction. 

Here are some examples from using Dalex to gain insights.

There are more graphs to explore. If you are interested in learning more about Dalex [check out this website](https://dalex.drwhy.ai/python/api/). Beside that, there a YouTube video that will teach you how to use Dalex to create some insightful graphs. [Click on this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sezHr78xxoM)



### Other Model Explainers

There are more than just these two, but SHAP is one of the most widely used in the community and has the most support. DALEX also appears to be somewhat popular. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and Microsoftâ€™s InterpretML are two other model explainers that you could use. If you're interested in learning more, you ask your nearest search engine.
